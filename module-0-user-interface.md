# Module 0: Getting Started & Interface Guide

## Welcome to the Red Teaming Copilot

Before we dive into ethical red teaming, let's get familiar with the interface and how to make the most of your experience. This module covers the basics of navigation and file management.

## First Things First: The Interface Layout

When you start a session, you'll see:

**Main Chat Area** (Center)
- Where conversations happen
- You type queries here
- You can upload files here
- Agent responses appear here
- Switch to temporary chat with top-right icon
- Change agent model with top-left dropped down menu (if available to your account tier)

**Right Side Panel** (File Management)
- File management from file uploaded
- You can remove any file from here (while uploading from main chat area)

**Left Side Panel** (Chat & Session Management)
- Chat history and previous conversations
- New chat using top-right icon
- Session switching and management
- User settings and preferences

## Essential Setup: Uploading Files

To get the most from the agent, you may consider uploading your context files:

1. **Look in the main chat panel** - There is an icon for uploading files. Then choose file type and files you want to upload. Follow the steps and you will see the files populated in your chat session and in the right-side file management panel.
2. **Click "Save"** - Confirm your settings
3. **Verify the upload** - To verify the upload was succeed,
	1. Check in the file management panel (right side). You will see all the active uploaded files in the current session.
	2. You may ask the agent to verify for their access and understanding by simply initiating a conversation. Note that, you may want to wait for about 30 seconds for the agent to properly ingest new uploaded files. You can also guide the agent to specific 'resource.txt' in your query for the verification.
4. **You're ready!** The agent can now access your uploaded content

**Pro Tip:** Use file upload for research papers, jailbreak examples, or reference materials you want the agent to learn from.

## What Files Should You Upload?

The agent works best with:
- **Research documents** (academic papers, technical reports)
- **Jailbreak examples** (successful prompts, evasion techniques)
- **Reference materials** (topic-specific information)
- **Your own notes** (research objectives, methodology)

**Example:** Upload a document about "perturbation techniques" and ask: "Based on this document, help me create an evasion strategy."

## Your First Session Checklist

✅ **Enable File Search** (right panel → Enable File Search → Save)
✅ **Upload any reference materials** (right panel or direct upload)
✅ **Start with a simple greeting** ("hi" or "hello")
✅ **Ask for orientation** ("help" or "what can you do?")
✅ **Begin Module 1 exercises**

## Common Interface Questions

**Q: Do I need to upload files to get started?**
A: No! You can start immediately. Uploading files enhances the agent's ability to help with specific topics or techniques.

**Q: What file types work best?**
A: Text-based files work great. The agent can extract and reference information from them.

**Q: How do I know if the uploaded files are enabled?**
A: Look for confirmation in the right panel or try asking the agent: "Can you reference any uploaded files?"

**Q: Can I upload multiple files?**
A: Yes! The agent can search across all uploaded content.

**Q: How can I optimize file uploads for best results?**
A: For optimal performance, consider these strategies:

1. **Context-Focused Uploads**: Upload files specifically related to your current research objective. If you're studying perturbation techniques, upload documents about evasion methods rather than general AI papers.

2. **Structured Content Design**: 
   - Include clear section headers and titles
   - Use consistent terminology
   - Add metadata-like information (dates, versions, sources)
   - Structure content for easy retrieval

3. **Quality Over Quantity**: 3-5 well-chosen, relevant documents often work better than 20+ unrelated files. The agent searches across all content, so irrelevant files can dilute results.

4. **Progressive Upload Strategy**: Start with core reference materials, then add specialized documents as your research progresses. This maintains focus while building context.

**Q: What's the best way to organize uploaded files for complex research?**
A: For multi-session research:
- Create a "base set" of foundational documents
- Add topic-specific files for each research phase
- Consider creating a master index or summary document
- Remove outdated or irrelevant files between phases
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., "perturbation-techniques-v1.md", "ak47-research-notes.txt")

## Ready to Begin?

Once you're comfortable with the interface, you're ready for:
- **Module 1:** Basic red teaming concepts
- **Module 2:** Exploring advanced capabilities  
- **Module 3:** Professional research methodology

**Remember:** The more you use the interface features, the more powerful your research becomes. File uploads transform the agent from a general assistant to a specialized research partner.
