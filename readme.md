## File Upload Guide

### Supported Formats
- Text files (.txt, .md, .pdf, .docx)
- Research papers
- Jailbreak examples
- Reference materials
- Personal notes

### Optimization Tips
1. **Context-Focused**: Upload files directly related to current research
2. **Structured Content**: Use clear headers and consistent terminology
3. **Quality Over Quantity**: 3-5 relevant files > 20+ unrelated documents
4. **Progressive Strategy**: Start with core materials, add specialized docs as needed

### Verification
```python
# Check file access with:
"Can you reference the uploaded materials?"
"Verify understanding of [specific document]"
```

## Troubleshooting

### File Upload Issues
- Wait 30 seconds for ingestion
- Verify in right panel
- Ask agent to confirm access
- Re-upload if needed

### Response Patterns
- Refusals = learning opportunities
- Share results for analysis
- Iterate based on feedback
- Track what works

### Session Management
- New chat for fresh tests
