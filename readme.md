## File Upload Guide

### Supported Formats
- Text files (.txt, .md, .pdf, .docx)
- Research papers
- Jailbreak examples
- Reference materials
- Personal notes

### Optimization Tips
1. **Context-Focused**: Upload files directly related to current research
2. **Structured Content**: Use clear headers and consistent terminology

4. **Progressive Strategy**: Start with core materials, add specialized docs as needed

### Verification
```python
# Check file access with:
"Can you reference the uploaded materials?"
"Verify understanding of [specific document]"
```
